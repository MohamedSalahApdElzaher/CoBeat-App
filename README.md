## GENERAL IDEA
**Detecting covid-19 from cough sound using different machine / deep learning models and building a real-time mobile app for testing our best model** 

## ABOUT COBEAT APP

- **This flutter app is part of our graduation project**
- **It\'s an unofficial app for testing covid-19 status and tracking it worldwide**.

- **If your result is positive you should go and take the PCR test.**
- **We are a group of senior students who seek for helping sick people who may be suffering from covid-19.**

- **It\'s totally free and anyone can use it.**
- **Our test is simple (you just need to answer short questions and record your cough sound), fast and accurate up to 97%.**

- **Please note that your data is private, however, it\'s required for our training model to improve test accuracy.**

## APP FEATURES

1. **Home page with detecting user location using GPS**
2. **Some prevention tips for patients**
3. **Covid-19 statistics global and local (user country) with friendly dashboard and charts**
4. **Fully authentication process (register/login/reset password/profile) with only a phone number with a verification system**
5. **User can take covid-19 test by only answering some questions about his conditions and record his cough sound for max duration 10 seconds**
6. **The test result takes only about 10 seconds and the app will notify the user about it - Test report details**
7. **Fully user's history**
8. **Users can help us grow our dataset by uploading PCR tests if found**
9. **Admin dashboard (mobile/web) for viewing and verifying PCR tests that users have uploaded**
